# Energy-Audit

A home energy audit  audit is a service in which the energy effectiveness of a house is assessed by a person utilising expert tools (such as blower doors and infrared cameras), with the goal of suggesting the best ways to increase energy efficiency in heating and cooling the house. 



A home's building envelope, which includes the walls, floors, ceilings, doors, windows, and skylights, may be the subject of an energy audit. The area and heat flow resistance (R-value) for each of these components are either measured or estimated. Air leakage or infiltration through the building envelope is a problem, and both are significantly impacted by window design and the calibre of door seals like weatherstripping. This experiment aims to measure the total thermal performance of the structure. The efficiency, physical state, and programming of mechanical systems like the thermostat and HVAC system may also be evaluated during the audit. 



A written report estimating energy use based on local climate parameters, thermostat settings, roof overhang, and sun direction may be included in a home energy audit. This might display the annual energy use as well as the effects of any suggested adjustments. When the homeowner's billing history is provided and shows the amounts of electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, or other energy sources consumed over a one- or two-year period, the accuracy of energy estimations is significantly increased.
